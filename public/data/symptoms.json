    "description": "Kernicterus is a rare and potentially serious condition that occurs when a baby has severe jaundice that is left untreated. It is characterized by high levels of bilirubin in the blood which can lead to a buildup of the substance in the brain, causing neurological damage.",
    "causes": "Kernicterus is typically caused by untreated or inadequately treated jaundice in newborn babies. Jaundice occurs when there is a high level of bilirubin in the blood, which causes the skin and eyes to appear yellow. If the bilirubin levels become too high and are not brought down quickly enough, it can lead to kernicterus.",
    "remedies": "The main treatment for kernicterus is to lower the levels of bilirubin in the blood. This can be done through phototherapy, where the baby is exposed to blue light which helps break down the bilirubin. In severe cases, a baby may need a blood transfusion to quickly lower the bilirubin levels. It is important for newborns to be monitored closely for jaundice and to receive appropriate treatment if necessary to prevent kernicterus.",
